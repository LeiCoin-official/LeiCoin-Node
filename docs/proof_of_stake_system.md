the next time a new committee is created by a random algorithm it can be included.

in this committee there are 32 slots.

at each slot a block proposer is choosen by a random algorithm and a the rest are attesters

the porposer then creates a block and send it to the rest of attesters

these attesters create a signature with there agreement on this block and send it back to the proposer.

the proposer now send it to the network if not they send just the emtpy slot with the slashing data
